# Endianness

This includes provides you with a set of procedures that allow you to easily swap the endianness and nibbles of all the basic types in PureBasic.

It also uses ASM instructions directly to avoid wasting cycles doing arithmetic shifts.

[ðŸ’¾ <sub>Source Code</sub>](../Includes/Endianness.pbi)


## Remarks

All the procedures in this include use ASM instructions which could cause problems if you use the same registers.

The registers used are the `rax` family in every procedure, and the `rdx` family in `EndianSwapQ()`.

And no constants or [enumeration id] were used.


There are [...] second procedure was specially made for and .u (and .a) variables to avoid any potential problem that could happen if you use "EndianSwapW" when declaring an implicitely typed variable.


## Macro

`+EndianSwap(Number)`<br>
&emsp;Gets replaced by the appropriate corresponding procedure by the compiler.


## Procedures

### 1 byte

`NibbleSwapB(Number.b).b`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `byte` number given as `Number.b` with it's nibbles swapped.

`NibbleSwapA(Number.a).a`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `ascii` number given as `Number.a` with it's nibbles swapped.


### 2 bytes

`EndianSwapW(Number.w).w`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `word` number given as `Number.w` with it's endianness swapped.

`EndianSwapU(Number.u).u`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `unicode` number given as `Number.u` with it's endianness swapped.


### 4 bytes

`EndianSwapL(Number.l).l`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `long` number given as `Number.l` with it's endianness swapped.


### 4/8 bytes

<sup>*The byte length of the number will be affected by the architecture for which your program is compiled [for].*</sup><br>
`EndianSwapI(Number.i).i`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `integer` number given as `Number.i` with it's endianness swapped.<br>


### 8 bytes

<sup>*The ASM instructions will vary depending on the architecture for which your program is compiled for, but the end result will stay the same.*</sup><br>
`EndianSwapQ(Number.q).q`<br>
&emsp;Returns the `quad` number given as `Number.q` with it's endianness swapped.


## Notes

A version of `EndianSwapQ()` that uses the SSE2 instruction set is available in the `Experiments/` folder as `EndianSwapQ_SSE.pbi`.

[^ In the file/include named: _x_ ^]

No speed test between the 2 version were done.

It is also important to mention that this special version uses both the `xmm0` and `xmm1` registers.

[The responsability falls on you to verify is the SSE2 instruction set is supported]
